# Welcome to "Flavor town" Cookbook!

## Discription

We are students from Linnaeus University doing a project course (1DV508). Our group, named "Feringhite 451," consists of six people: Artur Burlakin, Nabil Alharethi, Jenfear Park, Othman Alousi, Nils Piva, and Oskar Jonsson. In this "ReadMe," you will find the project structure and basic information.

# Stage One

Welcome page for users to begin browsing.

## Main Menu

### Background 
The background was designed together with AI and layers separated using the Adobe Photoshop application. The "stage one" background contains 5 layers, which give a parallax effect. More information about the parallax effect can be found here: [Parallax effect bucklet](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://cesar.esa.int/upload/201709/Parallax_Effect_Booklet.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwj_o6WZtdCGAxUTHhAIHZhMAQ8QFnoECBcQAw&usg=AOvVaw0Qq2DUJR666i4I1NIYLAqA)


### Title Screen

On the title screen, we can see our application's logo representing the entire team who worked on this application, which functions as a button leading to the next scene: User Book.

### User Book
![stage1Login](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ry2cbmNrA.jpg)

In the User Book, users are allowed to log in to their personal profiles containing their data.

After entering the correct credentials, the user is allowed to browse the application. The user is permitted to change their first name, last name, and password.

#### Extra
##### Admin Panel
![stageOneAdminPanel](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Skh7zQErA.jpg)

The book implements an Admin panel, where the admin can see how many users are in the application. The admin can also change users' names, passwords, delete accounts, or grant admin permissions.

### Registration

In registration section you allow to put your First, second name, unique username and password.

# Stage Two

After users log in, they have the option to explore various aspects of the app.

## Main Hub
![mainSTage2](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S19P6fVBR.jpg)

The Main Hub contains several options which users can interact with at the click of a mouse button. In the Main Hub, you can find the Market, Coffee Shop/Bakery, Library, and Restaurant.

### Market
![STage2Market](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJ1t6MEBA.jpg)

In the Market, we can select the ingredients we need and those we already have, functioning like a grocery list. Make a favorite ingredients.

### Coffee Shop/Bakery
![CafeShopStage2](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJZYTGVrR.jpg)

In the Coffee Shop/Bakery, you can add dishes to created weekly dinner lists (one, two, or more dishes per day).

After creating a weekly dinner list, users should be able to populate it with dishes for each day of the week and make their preferred meal prep.

### Library
![libraryStage2](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJUtTGNHA.jpg)

In the Library, users can add and look for recipes. The ultimate cookbook allows searching for specific recipes by ingredients or tags.

On the other hand, users can create their own recipes for the Ultimate Cookbook! (no admin rights needed).

### Restaurant
![Stage2Restaurant](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1u96zVHR.jpg)

In the Restaurant, users can exchange recipes with other user, rate recipes, and leave comments on them.
